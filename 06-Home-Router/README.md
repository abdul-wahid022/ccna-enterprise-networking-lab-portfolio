✓ Try releasing/renewing IP
✓ Check DHCP pool not exhausted
```

**Issue 4: Can't ping other devices**
```
Problem: Connectivity issues
Fix:
✓ Verify all devices on same network (192.168.0.x)
✓ Check subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
✓ Verify default gateway is 192.168.0.1
✓ Check firewall settings
```

**Issue 5: Static IP conflict**
```
Problem: IP address already in use
Fix:
✓ Use IPs outside DHCP range
✓ Check for duplicate IPs
✓ Document static IP assignments
✓ Recommended: Use .4-.50 for static
```

### Best Practices

**Wireless Security:**
```
✓ Always use WPA2-PSK or better
✓ Strong passphrase (12+ characters)
✓ Change default SSID
✓ Disable SSID broadcast for hidden networks (optional)
✓ Use MAC filtering for additional security (optional)
```

**IP Address Management:**
```
✓ Reserve low IPs (.2-.50) for static devices
✓ Let DHCP use higher range (.100+)
✓ Document all static IP assignments
✓ Keep consistent subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
✓ Always configure default gateway
```

**Physical Setup:**
```
✓ Place router centrally for WiFi coverage
✓ Use straight-through cables for PC-Switch-Router
✓ Label cables for easy troubleshooting
✓ Keep wireless devices within range
✓ Minimize interference (walls, metal objects)
```

**Testing:**
```
✓ Test connectivity after each phase
✓ Verify wireless before adding wired
✓ Ping router first, then other devices
✓ Test from multiple sources
✓ Document working configuration
```

### Network Design Tips

**For Home Networks:**
```
Wireless:
- SSID: Friendly name (avoid personal info)
- Security: WPA2-PSK minimum
- Channel: 1, 6, or 11 (2.4GHz) or Auto

IP Scheme:
- Router: 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1
- DHCP: 192.168.0.100-254
- Static: 192.168.0.2-99
```

**For Small Office:**
```
Separate VLANs (if supported):
- Guest WiFi: Separate SSID
- Employee devices: DHCP
- Servers/Printers: Static IPs
- IoT devices: Separate network
```
